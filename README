Welcome to the wiki for the as-of-now unnamed PowerShell Console Adventure Game! This wiki contains all sorts of information relative to the program including details for both players and programmers. The module is well documented so following along with it should be easy if you're interested in reading the source code.

# System Requirements

Although this is a PowerShell game, there are still some requirements!

* PowerShell Core 7.3.0 or greater (.NET 6.0 or greater)

# Playing Experience

Because there are a lot of factors that can be considered with modern terminal programs, especially those of theming, and for a variety of other reasons, it's not ideal to enforce a strict terminal styling. The following settings are what this program has been tested under and are in the opinion of the author the recommended settings. Of course, there's nothing enforcing any of these, so feel free to do as you please!

## Windows

* Windows Terminal using the PowerShell terminal (NOT Windows PowerShell)
* Color Scheme should be set to Tango Dark
* Font should be set to Cascadia Code
* Font Size should be set to 12
* Cursor Shape should be set to Bar (|)
* Transparency is optional, but if used, it should be set to 80%. Acrylic Material can be used as well.

## Linux

**NOTE: Audio functionality - at this point - may not work since the calls leverage the system speaker through the System.Beep API.**

* This program has been tested on GNOME Terminal and Konsole
* Color Scheme should be set to Tango Dark
* If installed, the Font should be set to Cascadia Code. Any monospaced font should work well. Alternative fonts that have been tested are Ubuntu Mono, IBM Plex Mono, and Fira Code.
* Font Size should be set to 12
* Transparency effects can have an impact on the colors, but in general are safe to use.

## MacOS

**NOTE: Audio functionality - at this point - may not work since the calls leverage the system speaker through the System.Beep API.**

* This program has been tested on Apple Terminal
* Color Scheme should be set to Pro
* If installed, the Font should be set to Cascadia Code. Any monospaced font should work well. Alternative fonts that have been tested are Monaco.
* Font Size should be set to 12
* Transparency effects can have an impact on the colors, but in general are safe to use.

# Starting the Game

**NOTE: Because this program is still in development, the following process is relative to testing. This process will likely mirror a production release, but the information here is for testing purposes only.**

1. Clone this repository to a local directory of your choice.
2. Change directory to the repository location.
3. Ensure that your Execution Policy is set to either Bypass on Unrestricted (the script is unsigned at this time).
4. Execute the NewEngineTest.ps1 file. This pulls in the NewEngine.psm1 module and executes some basic functionality.
