## Eldoria Legacy Source

This directory contains the legacy source code for the Eldoria game engine. The game, expressed in a still demo-scene state, can be launched using *EldoriaLoader.ps1*. However, and much to my chagrin, the beauty of the monolithic file that is *EldoriaAlpha.ps1* has been chopped into little pieces so that the project can conform to a PowerShell Module format. There have been some implications because of this, but they're necessary.

The maintenance of this code is for historical, emotional, and other reasons. The earliest code in here dates back a little over three years (at the time of writing) and might have some value to someone else. Anything _fancy_ I've tried to accomplish here I've done exclusively within PowerShell, aside from the use of Presentation Framework, without resorting to adding sophisticated dependencies. For whatever that artifical constraint is worth, it's driven a lot of the work here.

Going forward, no development work will occur here rendering this directory archival. I'll be more than happy to answer questions regarding the code contained here.
